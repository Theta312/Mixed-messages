Hello Github, and everyone. This will be my first portfolio project. It's a simple project, of a function. You type in your name where it says 'userName'.
You type in your age where it says 'age', and you type you eye color, where it says 'eyeColor'. Then by running the code, you will recieve a randomized
message based on the information you put.
